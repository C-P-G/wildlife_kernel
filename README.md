# wildlife_kernel
 
 The main goal is to automate the kernel function for the wildlife accidents in the nationalpark Bayrischer Wald. 
 
 ## Datasets 
 The datasets we are goin to use are 
 - wildlife accidents (2008-2019 from the bavarian police)
 -  Pointfeatures
 -  Streets from Openstreetmap as Polylines
 -  Basemap: Landcover.tif_Europe_Landcover(13/15)

## Worksteps 
- Buffer streets 
- intersection of streets and accidents 
- Kernelfunction
- output pdf with the Kernels with the highest values
- landscape analysis with the most intense Kernels, calculate the portion of forest/ meadow
